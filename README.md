![dev mode extension gif](./assets/dev-mode-extension-demo.gif)

When testing an extension in development, it's useful not to have any other extensions running in your browser.


One-Click Dev Mode is a simple utility to disable and restore all your Chrome extensions with one click. No more incognito window for testing. And no more conflicts between your favorite extensions and the extension you're building.

## How To Use
- Click toolbar button
- Do work...
- Click toolbar again
