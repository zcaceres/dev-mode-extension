When testing an extension in development, it's useful not to have any other extensions running in your browser.

One Click Dev Mode is a simple utility to toggle between your normal browser configuration and a dev mode with one click. No more incognito window for testing. And no more conflicts between your favorite extensions and the extension you're building.

## How To Use
- Enable and disable all the extensions you want in your normal browsing environment
- Click toolbar button
- Enable and disable all the extensions you want for your dev environment (or enable none at all)
- Click toolbar again

That's it! Dev Mode will remember your configurations and switch between them.
