When testing an extension in development, it's useful not to control which extensions are active in your browser.

*One Click Dev Mode* is a simple utility to toggle between two sets of browser extensions. One is for normal browser, the other is a dev mode. You can toggle with one click.

When in Dev Mode, the browser will show a 'D'.

No more incognito window for testing. And no more conflicts between your favorite extensions and the extension you're building.

## How To Use
- Enable and disable all the extensions you want in your normal browsing environment
- Click toolbar button
- Enable and disable all the extensions you want for your dev environment (or enable none at all)
- Click toolbar again

That's it! Dev Mode will remember your configurations. Switch between them by clicking the button.
